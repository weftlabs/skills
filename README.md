# Weft Skills

Canonical agent skills for [Weft](https://weft.network) — search the agent
web and pay any x402/MPP endpoint from a wallet the user controls.

**This repo is the single source of truth.** Every other place a Weft
skill appears — `weft.network`, the Claude plugin, the `@weftlabs/cli`
npm package — is a byte-identical mirror pinned to one commit of this repo
by a `SKILLS_REF` file and enforced by that consumer's CI drift check.
Never edit a mirror. To change a skill: PR this repo, merge, then bump
each consumer's `SKILLS_REF` and re-vendor.

## Skills

| Skill | Job | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| [`weft`](skills/weft/SKILL.md) | Find and buy paid data, APIs, and real-world actions: the search → choose → fetch loop, receipts, spending safety. [`rules/cli.md`](skills/weft/rules/cli.md) adds the machine-local CLI surface. | Installed; persists on the host |
| [`weft-setup`](skills/weft-setup/SKILL.md) | Connect a user's Weft Account from any surface: plugin, MCP config ([per-host shapes](skills/weft-setup/rules/hosts.md)), connector UI, or bootstrap a new account. | One-shot; fetched, executed, discarded |
| [`weft-flights-search`](skills/weft-flights-search/SKILL.md) | Experimental Weft-powered flight research with route, schedule, fare, nearby-airport, and ground-transfer evidence. | Experimental outcome workflow |
| [`weft-gtm-lead-enrichment`](skills/weft-gtm-lead-enrichment/SKILL.md) | Enrich a LinkedIn profile, find or verify a work email, or retrieve a social newsfeed through OneShot Agent. | Optional workflow; experimental |

## Install

```sh
npx skills add weftlabs/skills --skill weft --skill weft-setup
```

Install an optional workflow separately:

```sh
npx skills add weftlabs/skills --skill weft-flights-search
npx skills add weftlabs/skills --skill weft-gtm-lead-enrichment
```

Use the space-separated `--skill <name>` form. Do not use
`--skill=<name>`; affected Skills CLI versions can ignore that filter and
install every skill in the repository.

Each optional workflow also owns a `1600x900` `cover.webp` beside its
`SKILL.md`. The public repository contains the finished cover, not Weft's
internal mascot source or generation workflow. Core skills do not appear in the
gallery and do not need a cover.

Or point an agent at the hosted copies:

- Setup (start here): `https://weft.network/setup.md`
- Usage: `https://weft.network/skills/weft/SKILL.md`

## Distribution
