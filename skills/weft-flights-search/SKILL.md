# Weft Flight Search

Find the cheapest credible flight, compare nonstop and connecting options when
requested, and include a nearby-airport option when the main airport is poor.
This experimental workflow was distilled from
one Berlin-to-Puglia search on 2026-08-14. It provides workflow evidence, not a
permanent provider catalog or a promise that old prices still apply.

Load the `weft` skill before using this workflow. Its live search, request,
attribution, receipt, and spending rules are authoritative.

## Experimental Status

This workflow is published for testing before its goal lab is complete. The
production catalog currently has no verified operation that binds all required
flight inputs: outbound date/date range, trip type, and nonstop. This does not
make route, airport, or schedule operations useless. Use Weft as the paid
research substrate: buy the cheapest live operations that reduce uncertainty,
compose their outputs into the candidate set, and use a public booking surface
to verify exact fares, market coverage, baggage rules, and itinerary details
that no current Weft contract can supply. Never label a route probe as an
exact-date fare.

## User Goal

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Specific problem | Given dates, passenger and baggage requirements, a destination, a stop rule, and a ground-travel limit, return one price-ranked table of viable flight-plus-transfer options |
| Inputs | Origin, destination, trip type, outbound dates or date range, return dates or date range when applicable, passenger count, cabin, baggage, maximum stops, and maximum ground-transfer time |
| Outcome | A recommendation with exact-date flight fares, transfer costs, comparable total costs, schedules, fare basis, and evidence links |
| Acceptance | Every recommended row has date-bound fare evidence for the requested baggage basis, a ground-transfer price or explicit no-transfer value, a comparable total cost, and confirmation that it meets the time limit |
| Independent truth | The airline or booking surface for fares and baggage; the transport operator or current journey planner for ground legs |
| Limits | Never purchase or reserve travel; obey the user's spend and transfer-time limits; disclose all unknown mandatory charges |
| Non-goals | Booking tickets, bypassing protected booking APIs, or presenting schedules and route-level teaser fares as purchasable options |

## Limited Weft Operation

### x402 Atlas / `bazaar-x402-atlas-82`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Compare itineraries for up to five origin and five destination airport codes; not a date/nonstop fare search |
| Request | `GET https://flights.use.x402atlas.com/search/:departure/:arrival` |
| Path bindings | `departure <- departure_airports`; `arrival <- arrival_airports` |
| Query/body/headers | None declared |
| Execution | Synchronous terminal response |
| Price / protocol | `$0.05` observed / x402 on Base |
| Contract source | `bazaar-x402-atlas-82` contract captured 2026-08-26; paid calibration 2026-08-29 |

Inputs are one to five comma-separated IATA codes for each side. The operation
has no input for date, date range, trip type, cabin, passenger count, bags,
currency, or nonstop.

| JSON pointer | Type | Nullable | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/queried_at` | date-time string | no | Provider query timestamp |
| `/outbound_date` | date string | no | Provider-selected date, not caller-bound |
| `/return_date` | date string | yes | Provider-selected return date |
| `/trip_type` | string | no | Provider-selected trip type |
| `/currency` | string | no | Fare currency |
| `/best_flights/*/price` | number | no | Itinerary price |
| `/best_flights/*/flights` | array | no | Flight segments |
| `/best_flights/*/layovers` | array | yes | Connections; non-empty means not nonstop |

The missing date and nonstop bindings make this operation unsuitable for a
final fare result, but it can still identify candidate airlines, airports,
connections, schedules, and provider-selected price signals. Buy it when those
fields will reduce the remaining public research and the live price fits the
user's spending policy. Label every returned date and price as provider-selected,
not user-bound. Call a returned amount a fare only when the response states its
passenger, cabin, baggage, and trip basis; otherwise call it a price signal. A
zero-row route probe is not proof that no route exists.

## Required Flow

### 1. Record the request

Record the trip type, dates or date ranges, airports or region, maximum stops,
passenger count, cabin, baggage, and maximum ground-transfer time. Require a
return date only for a return trip. Start with the requested airport. Add
alternatives only when a credible public-transport route meets the limit.

### 2. Discover current providers

Call `weft_search` for current schedules and fares. Read each result's typed
inputs, request bindings, price, output summary, attribution, and current
`contract_url`. Do not hard-code the historical provider above.

Classify each useful operation by the evidence it can provide: airport,
route, schedule, availability, or exact fare. Map every required user
constraint to a declared provider input before treating an operation as the
final fare source. A final fare operation needs origin, destination, outbound
dates or requested date range, return dates or range for a return trip, trip
type, passenger and cabin basis, baggage basis, and stop filtering, and must
return exact itinerary dates. A missing binding makes the operation a limited
probe that can still contribute evidence; it does not make the operation
worthless.

### 3. Build the candidate set with Weft

Choose the cheapest non-redundant operations that materially reduce uncertainty.
Typical composition is:

1. an airport or route-matrix operation to compare the requested airports with
   credible nearby alternatives
2. a route or schedule operation to identify nonstop airlines, connection
   airports, flight numbers, and operating days
3. a contract-complete fare operation when the live catalog has one

Do not require one provider to solve the whole search. A good Weft search can
compose several narrow providers. Do not buy a probe merely to satisfy this
workflow: its declared output must answer a real open question in the search.

Before the first paid call, use `weft_balance`. State the expected cost, build
the request from the live contract, copy all attribution fields, and set a tight
`max_cost_usd`. For each `weft_fetch`, record the operation's evidence class,
route, dates and fares if present, currency, schedule, provider, contract gaps,
receipt state, and actual paid plus held amount.

Do not retry a paid call after a timeout, pending receipt, or ambiguous result,
and do not buy the same evidence from a substitute provider. Report the receipt
and stop the paid stage unless the user explicitly accepts the risk of another
charge. Free searches and public verification can continue.

### 4. Separate schedules from fares

A schedule proves that a route is planned. It does not prove a seat or current
price. A fare proves only the quoted dates, passenger mix, cabin, and baggage
basis. Do not stop after schedule research when the user asked for prices.
Never rank an option with a route-level "from" price.

Keep an evidence ledger for each candidate. Mark each fact as `Weft exact
fare`, `Weft provider-selected price signal`, `Weft schedule`, `Weft route`,
or `public booking verification`. Use `Weft exact fare` only when the live
request contract binds the requested airport pair, outbound dates or date range,
return dates or range for a return trip, trip type, passenger count, cabin,
baggage basis, and stop filter, and the response confirms the exact selected
dates and other values. Otherwise keep the amount as a price signal. This lets
Weft shape the search without silently upgrading limited evidence.

### 5. Verify fares and market coverage

Use the Weft-built candidate set to prioritize research, not to bound the
market: provider coverage can omit airlines or routes that operate on the
requested dates even when its fare contract is complete. Before any cheapest
claim, run an independent exact-date coverage check on a broad public booking
surface and check relevant low-cost carriers separately. If Weft has no
contract-complete fare source, verify candidate fares on the airline's public
booking form or fare calendar too.

Record the coverage scope: every viable origin/destination airport pair,
requested stop class, and requested outbound date or, for return trips,
outbound/return date combination checked. Use a date grid when the surface
supports one; otherwise record the outbound dates or outbound/return
combinations searched. Search each date or date combination with the passenger
count, cabin, and baggage basis. Scope every cheapest claim to the recorded
sources, dates, and returned candidates unless exhaustive coverage is proven;
checking every airport pair and stop class on one aggregator is not exhaustive.
Reject optional cookies when possible. Read the fare only after all dates
required by the trip type are selected.

Record whether each displayed amount is one-way, per leg, or the itinerary
total. If the meaning is unclear, do not add values or call one value a return
fare. Do not evade bot checks, call signed private APIs, or complete a purchase.

Check low-cost carriers separately when the main fare source does not cover
them. State which fare evidence came from outside Weft.

### 6. Escalate dynamic booking pages through Weft

When search results or static extraction cannot expose a required fare,
baggage rule, or itinerary detail, call `weft_search` for browser automation,
JavaScript rendering, or interactive extraction. Buy the suitable service
through `weft_fetch`; do not bypass Weft discovery or payment with a vendor API,
vendor MCP, or separately funded vendor account. After Weft purchases access,
use only the connection protocol declared by its contract.

Prove the full result path before paying. A suitable operation must return a
terminal result, document a free poll that this host can authenticate, or
return a browser connection that this host can consume without printing its
URL, token, or signing key into tool output, transcripts, commands, or files.
Preflight this secure handoff before payment; a raw `weft_fetch` result that
prints connection credentials makes that operation ineligible on the current
host. Do not pay for submission-only work when the result cannot be recovered.
Prefer static extraction when it answers the question; use a browser session
only for fields that require clicks or form input.

Creating a remote session is a side effect. Show its duration, expected cost,
and task, and get explicit confirmation unless the user already requested that
exact session. Keep the browsing itself read-only: reject optional cookies, do
not log in, and stop before reservation, hold, passenger-data entry, or
purchase. Close or terminate the remote session when the task ends. Keep facts
from public airline or booking pages labeled `public booking verification`.
Record Weft browser access separately with the operation, receipt, timestamp,
canonical or redacted public page URL, and any unresolved ambiguity. Remove
session IDs, signed query parameters, tokens, and URL fragments from recorded
sources.

### 7. Price the complete trip

For every viable airport, record:

- ground route, duration, and price
- exact-date flight base fare
- required baggage or seat charges
- comparable total cost, including requested baggage
- optional costs that remain unknown
- door-to-airport and flight times

Do not invent a transport fare or add-on hidden inside a locked flow. Keep
currencies separate unless using a cited exchange rate with a timestamp. Label
converted totals as approximate.

### 8. Apply the completion gate

Before ranking an option, confirm that its row contains:

- exact outbound date and exact return date when the trip type requires one
- flight numbers or schedule evidence for every leg, consistent with the
  requested stop rule
- exact-date fare labeled one-way, per leg, or return
- passenger, cabin, and baggage basis
- ground route, duration, and price, or `none`
- comparable total cost with all mandatory charges included
- source links and search timestamp

Continue researching while a viable option lacks its flight price, requested
baggage price, or comparable total. If access controls block exact fares,
return a short blocked report naming the missing prices and exact-date booking
links. Do not substitute teaser prices.

### 9. Present the result

Lead with the cheapest verified option that meets the requested stop rule. When
the user asks to compare nonstop and connecting flights, show the cheapest
verified row in each class before other main-airport or nearby-airport options
that materially differ in price or timing.

If the exact requested dates have no matching nonstop, do **not** stop at
"none found." Add a second table of useful alternatives: nearest operated
dates for that route, one-stop connections on the requested dates, and
airport-plus-train when the ground leg is under the user's time limit. Label
each row `not requested date` or `connection` so it is not mixed with an
exact-date nonstop fare.

Use this table:

`origin | ground leg/time/cost | airline/flight | departure-arrival | fare basis | exact-date flight fare | comparable total cost | source | confidence`

State what each Weft purchase contributed, the total Weft paid plus held amount,
the schedule and fare sources, claims verified outside Weft, unresolved facts,
and the search timestamp. A final answer that used a suitable paid Weft probe
must not summarize the Weft stage as "unrelated data" merely because public
verification supplied the terminal fare.

## Failure Rules

- A 503 or rate-limited empty result is unknown, not "no flights."
- A contract without date, trip type, or stop inputs is not a matching exact
  fare operation, even if its description says "live itineraries"; it can still
  be a useful route or schedule probe.
- A paid upstream 400/500 is not a reason to retry the same paid request.
- An empty exact-date nonstop set is not the end of the job. Offer other
  dates and connections before "none found."
- A scheduled route without fare evidence is not a purchasable offer.
- A route-level sale price cannot rank an exact-date option.
- A fare with unclear one-way, per-leg, or return semantics is unresolved.
- Flight options without prices are not a completed price comparison.
- A GDS result set without a low-cost carrier is not complete market coverage.
- An airport over the user's ground-time limit is not a valid alternative.
- A held or pending Weft payment may have moved money. Do not retry it.

## Data and Safety Rules

- Follow the current `weft` skill for balance, caps, attribution, and receipts.
- Never print wallet keys, payment proofs, auth headers, or provider secrets.
- State actual paid plus held amount, not only the indexed price.
- Preserve currency and fare basis. Do not compare unlike fares silently.
- Include a timestamp and sample scope with every recommendation.

## Provenance

- Distilled from session `01a0003f-a18b-7c4c-8a59-1f8d31c4e6b2`
  (2026-08-14), trace `.traces/2026-08-15-weft-flight-research.zip`.
- Initial trace sample: one archived research-only session, one Weft search,
  two CLI fetches, and eight SDK fetches; three fetches failed.
- Production calibration on 2026-08-29: three free catalog searches and one
  x402 Atlas route-matrix fetch (`$0.05` held, HTTP 200, artifact `360`).
- Revised from price-omission feedback in OpenCode session
  `ses_fa76f88b9ffezI2jswkjcQO8io` on 2026-08-31. The current `session-trace`
  script cannot archive OpenCode sessions, so this is additional research
  evidence, not goal-lab evidence.
- Revised after OpenCode session `ses_fa3e4911bffdg0jnkZnvS0okkX` proved the
  all-or-nothing payment gate discarded useful Weft evidence. A 2026-09-01
  route-matrix fetch for `ZRH` to `BKK,DMK` cost `$0.05` held and returned
  direct flights, connection candidates, airport coverage, and provider-selected
  price signals (artifact `389`), while exact January fares still required a
  date-bound public booking search.
- A later unarchived research session tested browser escalation through live
  Weft discovery.
  Browser Use was rejected before payment because its submission-only contract
  had no poll this host could authenticate. Browserbase returned a five-minute
  CDP session for `$0.01` held (artifact `391`), but its connection credentials
  appeared in tool output and this host had no secure handoff to Playwright.
  The session expired unused. This post-payment failed experiment established
  the preflight rule above: Browserbase is ineligible on this host until a
  secret-safe handoff exists, and it does not prove successful browser
  extraction.
- Prices and provider contracts are historical evidence. Live results own all
  current facts.
